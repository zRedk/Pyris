# Pyris

**WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2025 Winner**

Pyris is a mindful game designed to help players learn how to cope with panic attacks through the calming power of controlled breathing.

## What is Pyris?

**Breathe in. Hold. Breathe out.**  
Let the rhythm guide you to calm.

In a quiet, enchanted forest, a small flame named Pyris dances freely. But when a storm rolls in â€“ her deepest fear â€“ everything changes.  
Help Pyris find peace, navigate through the fear, and weather the storm.

This is a gentle, emotional journey designed to soothe, not stress.
